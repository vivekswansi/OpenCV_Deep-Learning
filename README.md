# OpenCV_Deep-Learning

**Problem Statement**
1) Identify deep leaning models for images and videos processing which can perform:
2) Lane detection (Physical lane on floor)
3) Object Identification & inference
4) Models that can give performance near to 30 FPS based upon low end devices
5) Send Alerts

**Solution**
1) The solution is an amalgamation of IOT and AI 
2) AI based deep learning models is used to identify real time feed from onboard Camera and infer the lane, objects and avoid obstacles.
3) On board Arduino will help to navigate the Vehicle based on the outcome from the learning (running on deep learning models deployed in raspberry pi)
4) Jave Spring based application to provide UI and store/send alerts

**Key Features**
It will help us to identify Image / Video based deep learning models which will can be further used for 
1) Automotive manufacturers (Autonomous vehicles/robots)
2) Automatic Warehouse vehicles
3) Learn Objects such as Vehicles, Traffic Signs, Potholes  etc. and store it for further processing


**Improvements (TBD)**
1) Do Potholes detections and share it across with Municipal agencies and other aggregators
2) Objects identification can be further integrated with Google Maps API to identify actual GPS location on Google Maps
3) AI learning & inference can be further done on Cloud 
4) On board Arduino can use respective sensors to fetch the actual distance
5) OEM based H/W for image processing & Day/Night IR camera can be used 

**Architecture**
